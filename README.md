# Code Fellows Ops and Cyber Security
## Class 201-d6
### Code Challenge Repository

This repo contains files for my solutions to code challenges given by our instructos at Code Felllows on our journey to become Cyber Security Profesionals.

## Topics and Reflection

In this portion of the course we have learn about basic network operations, IT desk solutions , scripting and automation.

This skills helps us better understand the job perform by IT Profesionals, from remote solutions like retiving deleted files to hardrive nuking and PC imaging.

## Code Reflection

So far the scripts we are creating could be very useful for IT desk profesionals for automating onboarding personel to task automation and run security checks. 

## Path to a Cyber Security Profesional

In the future I would like to come back and revisit and improve challenges that with logging important network information, to use them in the future and make my job easier.

I will also like to revisit my code challenges to properly document and comment on them explaining better how they funtion and what they do.
